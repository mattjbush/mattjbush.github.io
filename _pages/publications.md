High-Skill Labor Cyclicality and the Role of Pay Type (Job Market Paper)  
(draft coming soon)    

College graduates have a lower cyclical volatility of hours per worker than those without a college degree. I show empirically that pay type can account for roughly half of this difference. Non-college graduates are more than twice as likely to be paid by the hour, and hourly workers have more cyclically volatile hours per worker than salaried workers. Using a model with two-sided search and matching in which a matched firm and worker bargain over hours per period, I show how pay type itself can matter for labor outcomes. The model delivers a lower volatility of hours per worker among the salary type because a sticky salary distorts the bargaining process differently than a sticky wage. Additionally, I find that employment volatility in the model is higher for hourly workers, with salaried workers’ employment volatility being substantially closer to the version with perfectly flexible pay.


Correlation in Spouses’ Employment Status and the Value of a Second Earner  
(draft coming soon)  

When a worker transitions to unemployment, there is a higher chance that her employed spouse becomes unemployed as well. Similarly, there is a positive correlation in unemployed spouses' transitions to employment. In this paper, I document that the cross-correlations of spouses' employment transitions increased between 1976 and 2019. The doubling of the share of same-occupation couples explains some but not all of the increase in the cross-correlation of job separations. I then use a quantitative model of household labor supply with labor frictions to measure the impact of this trend on households' wellbeing and labor supply. As spouses’ employment transitions become more correlated, their unemployment spells become more overlapping, reducing the marginal benefit of a second earner. As a result, married women’s labor force participation falls by 0.6%.
