High-Skill Labor Cyclicality and the Role of Pay Type (Job Market Paper)
(draft coming soon)
Abstract:  College graduates have a lower cyclical volatility of hours per worker than those without a college degree. I show empirically that pay type can account for roughly half of this difference. Non-college graduates are more than twice as likely to be paid by the hour, and hourly workers have more cyclically volatile hours per worker than salaried workers. Using a model with two-sided search and matching in which a matched firm and worker bargain over hours per period, I show how pay type itself can matter for labor outcomes. The model delivers a lower volatility of hours per worker among the salary type because a sticky salary distorts the bargaining process differently than a sticky wage. Additionally, I find that employment volatility in the model is higher for hourly workers, with salaried workersâ€™ employment volatility being substantially closer to the version with perfectly flexible pay.
