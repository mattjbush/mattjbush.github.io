"High-Skill Labor Cyclicality and the Role of Pay Type" (Job Market Paper)  
(draft coming soon)    

College graduates have a lower cyclical volatility of hours per worker than those without a college degree. I show empirically that pay type can account for almost half of this volatility gap. Non-college graduates are more than twice as likely to be paid by the hour, and hourly workers have more cyclically volatile hours per worker than salaried workers. Using a model with two-sided search and matching in which a matched firm and worker bargain over hours per period, I show how pay type itself can matter for labor outcomes. The model delivers a lower volatility of hours per worker among the salary type because a sticky salary distorts the bargaining process differently than a sticky wage. Additionally, I find that employment volatility in the model is higher for hourly workers, with salaried workers’ employment volatility being substantially closer to the version with perfectly flexible pay.

"Correlation in Spouses’ Employment Status and the Value of a Second Earner"  
(draft coming soon)  

Among both-employed couples, the cross-correlation of transitions into unemployment is positive. Similarly, unemployed couples tend to find jobs in the same period. In this paper, I document that the correlations in spouses’ employment transitions are not only positive but increasing over the last 45 years. The doubling of the share of same-occupation couples explains some but not all of this trend. I then use a quantitative model of household labor supply with labor frictions to measure the impact of this trend on households’ wellbeing and labor supply. As spouses’ employment transitions become more correlated, their unemployment spells become more overlapping, reducing the marginal benefit of a second earner. As a result, married women’s labor force participation falls by 0.6%.
